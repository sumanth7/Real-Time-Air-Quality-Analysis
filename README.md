# Real-Time-Air-Quality-Analysis
Project aim is to process the data coming from pollution sensor and visualize over a map real time.

The proposed system uses low cost and low power devices with gas sensors to capture the air quality index from the atmosphere. 
Raw sensor data collected from the gas sensors sent to the cloud using an android application.
In cloud, the data is stored and processed. The processed data is visualized in real time on a map using an
open-source geospatial data visualization framework such as Leaflet using R programming.
